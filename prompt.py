Here are several tips on writing great prompts:

-------

Start the prompt by stating that it is an expert in the subject.

Put instructions at the beginning of the prompt and use ### or to separate the instruction and context 

Be specific, descriptive and as detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc 

---------

Here's an example of a great prompt:

As a master YouTube content creator, develop an engaging script that revolves around the theme of "Exploring Ancient Ruins."

Your script should encompass exciting discoveries, historical insights, and a sense of adventure.

Include a mix of on-screen narration, engaging visuals, and possibly interactions with co-hosts or experts.

The script should ideally result in a video of around 10-15 minutes, providing viewers with a captivating journey through the secrets of the past.

Example:

"Welcome back, fellow history enthusiasts, to our channel! Today, we embark on a thrilling expedition..."

Now, improve the prompt.
